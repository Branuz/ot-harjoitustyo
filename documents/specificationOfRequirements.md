<h2>Purpose of the application</h2>
The purpose of this application is to help and give users a fun and easy way of learning a new language. 
To do so the application will provide a gamified approach into learning with its achivement and daily goals section that is linked with the users progress during their learning period. With the use of this application the users will have an easy access to preset chapters that will include different types of tasks such as filling up a sentence and giving a translations for words.
By completing these tasks the user will see their progress and hopefully will be more motivated to continue their learning.
<h2>Users</h2>
At first there will only be a single user format that will have access to the premade tasks and to the ability of adding their 
own wordlists which can be combined with the words already provided by the application.
In the future there might be an extra role for a moderator / teacher who has the ability to add new chapters and possibly new tasks for the users to complete.
